## Creating 8 bit characters

1. The HTML consists on two div's, the outer div is used to create a grid, and the inner div is used to fill the grid using the box-shadow property.
2. In CSS you set the width, and height of the parent div, then set the child div's width and height to 1 unit.
3. Use the box-shadow property on the child div to fill in the grid with your colors.

I used [this video from FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjlHcmEclFE) as a reference for creating this project.
